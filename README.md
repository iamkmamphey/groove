# Groove Loop App - Project Skeleton

This is a minimal, editable project skeleton for the **Groove Loop** mobile app system:
- **MobileApp** (.NET MAUI) - basic UI skeleton and example instrument card.
- **Api** (ASP.NET Core Web API) - minimal controllers and models for instruments.
- **Admin** (Blazor Server) - simple upload/management pages skeleton.
- **Shared** - DTOs and models shared between projects.
- **WaveformGenerator** - scripts to generate waveform images from audio (ffmpeg/audiowaveform).

**Purpose:** Open this solution in **Visual Studio** and expand the components.
This skeleton provides structure, interfaces, and example code to get started.

Notes:
- Audio playback in MAUI uses LibVLCSharp in the design notes (not fully integrated).
- Waveform generation requires `audiowaveform` and `ffmpeg` on the server/desktop.
- Replace placeholders with real implementation for production.
